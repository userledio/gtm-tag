# gtm-tag

Official Google Tag Manager tag template for Userled.

This tag enables full integration with Userled's SDK without a single line of code.

## Maintenance

Once a new release is ready, take note of the release-ready commit hash. Create another commit and update `metadata.yaml` [like so](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/templates/gallery#update_your_template).

Any changes to the snippet code must align with the raw snippet used by direct integrators.
